## Examples used in JS101 session on Event-Async

- `DOM` and `timers` directories: Open *index.html* in browser, and open the console. (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+J). Try changing things in the .js files and see what is happening in the browser.
- `XHR`: This is just for looking at the code - original way of making Ajax calls, using XMLHttpRequest object, vs using jquery. 
- `ajax-weather`: An old example from a Sitepoint course and book https://github.com/spbooks/javascript1/tree/master/ajax. I liked it because it is so simple and you don\'t need to sign up for an API key. But it could do with a rewrite (have already changed XML data to json). To look at the example in the browser: Go to the root directory (i.e. ajax-weather), and start a server with PHP: ```php -S localhost:8000```
